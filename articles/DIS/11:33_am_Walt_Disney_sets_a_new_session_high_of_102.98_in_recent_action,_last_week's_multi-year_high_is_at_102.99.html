This will likely result in a smaller than average decline, or perhaps even an increase, in AXP reported discount rate as Costco U.S. volumes roll off in 2016.</li><li>Generally speaking, the revenue and profits on the spending inside Costco U.S. are much lower than on spending outside of Costco. Therefore AXP will focus on customers who frequently use their card at non-Costco merchants.</li><li>If the portfolio is sold, that could generate a gain at time of the sale, and obviously it would also impact the loan run-off trajectory.</li></ul></li><li>Competitors <b>COF</b> (+2.2%), <b>DFS</b> (+1.1%) are trading higher as a result, along with<b> V</b> (+1.3%) and <b>MA</b> (+2.3%)</li></ul><p><b>10:15 am S&amp;P +14 and Nasdaq Comp +38 set new session highs, Dow +72 has not yet confirmed the move (:TECHX)</b> :  </p><p><b>10:01 am Home Loan Servicing; Mangrove Partners nominates a full slate of five individuals for election to the Board of Directors  (<a href="/q?s=hlss" name="hlss">HLSS</a>)</b> : Co announced it has formally nominated the following individuals for election to the Board of Directors of HLSS at its upcoming 2015 Annual General Meeting of shareholders: <br/>Nathaniel August (President of Mangrove Partners) Kevin J.
