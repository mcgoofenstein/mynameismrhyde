found article: New apps to help business get in step with mobile customers - Fri 27 Mar 12:12:45 UTC-04:00 2015 - [Reuters] - Nine months after Apple and IBM began working together on building mobile apps for businesses, some of the first fruits are about to appear at UK pharmacy chain Boots, which has begun equipping store employees with iPads to serve shoppers in the aisles. These customer service apps are part of a bid by Boots to encourage consumers to pre-order cosmetics and toiletries online, similar to calling ahead for medical prescriptions, while turning its 2,500 retail outlets into convenient pick-up points. "These apps put all of Boots' inventory at (employees') fingertips," said Robin Phillps, who is in charge of digital and e-commerce business at the company, now part of Walgreens Boots Alliance. Companies across dozens of different industries are now eyeing how these mobile business apps from Apple and IBM can hook up front-line staff to back-office systems and make them smarter in face-to-face dealings with customers in the field.

Businesses throttled back on inventory and equipment investment, but robust consumer spending limited the slowdown in the pace of activity. Corporate profits from outside the United States fell at an 8.8 percent rate, the steepest decline since the 2007-2009 recession.

found article: Outbound Chinese buyers confounding the doubters - Thu 26 Mar 16:00:00 UTC-04:00 2015 - [Reuters] - Backed by cheap funding and a huge home market, an army of mostly state-owned Chinese companies has marched beyond its borders, snapping up assets in a decade-long $391 billion shopping spree. For non-resources companies, Reuters reviewed China's 25 biggest overseas acquisitions of three years or older to determine the evolution of share price, revenue and margins. For seven of the deals there was insufficient information because either the target, the acquirer or both were unlisted. Success stories include the landmark 2004 purchase of International Business Machines' personal computer unit by Lenovo Group, the 2010 purchase of Ford Motor's Volvo car unit by Geely Automobile Holdings, and Dalian Wanda's 2012 purchase of U.S. cinema chain AMC Entertainment.

found article: IBM buys AlchemyAPI to boost Watson computing unit - Wed 04 Mar 07:33:14 UTC-04:00 2015 - [Reuters] - International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) said on Wednesday it had acquired AlchemyAPI, a fast-growing startup selling software that collects and analyzes unstructured text and data in ways big enterprises, website publishers and advertisers find useful. The purchase is designed to boost IBM's push into more human-like computing services, based around its Watson technology, which can sift huge amounts of data, learn from the results and respond to spoken questions. IBM is trying to build a big business around Watson, which came to prominence in 2011 when it beat two previous champions on the U.S. quiz show Jeopardy. IBM gives developers access to Watson so they can use the technology in their own applications, but it has only just started to filter down to mainstream use.

Palo Alto-based HP follows Microsoft Corp and International Business Machines Corp in seeing a significant negative impact from the strong dollar. The computer and printer units, which will make up HP Inc under the separation plan, saw combined revenue fall 1.8 percent from the year-ago quarter to $14 billion, while the rest of the company, to be known as Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, saw revenue fall 4.9 percent to about $13.6 billion.

Google has been the target of a European Commission investigation since November 2010, when more than a dozen complainants, including Microsoft Corp, accused the company of promoting its own services at their expense. In February, Google agreed to make concessions on how it displays competitors' links, striking a deal that ended a three-year antitrust probe and avoided a hefty fine. Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said at the time he would accept Google's concessions without conducting a formal market test, prompting a furious response.

Google granted to holders of its existing "A" and "B" class of stock one share of the new non-voting "Class C" stock for each share of the other two classes The special dividend, first announced in January and distributed late Wednesday, operates like a stock split. The third type of Google shares, "Class B," which are not traded on the exchange, grant 10 times the voting right of each "A" share and most are held by the California company's founders, Sergey Brin and Larry Page. Some analysts see Google's move as a sign the company plans to finance future acquisitions with a larger base of stock.
