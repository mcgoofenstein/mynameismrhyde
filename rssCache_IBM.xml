A lawsuit filed by New York state-based IBM on Monday in US federal district court accuses the travel and reservations company of building its business model on long-time patented IBM technology. IBM said in the legal filing that it turned to the court after three years of fruitless efforts to negotiate licensing fees with Priceline Group, which operates priceline.com, opentable.com and kayak.com. The four patents at issue in the case include technology involving advertising, signing onto websites, and tracking what shoppers are selecting, according to the lawsuit.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">yahoo_finance/1022789910</guid><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2015 14:33:44 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Softbank to add learning technology to empathetic robot</title><link>http://us.rd.yahoo.com/finance/news/rss/story/*http://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/softbank-add-learning-technology-empathetic-101335764.html</link><description></description><guid isPermaLink="false">yahoo_finance/2551833420</guid><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2015 13:52:54 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>IBM sues Priceline for patent infringement in U.S. court</title><link>http://us.rd.yahoo.com/finance/news/rss/story/*http://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/ibm-sues-priceline-patent-infringement-224334093.html</link><description></description><guid isPermaLink="false">yahoo_finance/3760186822</guid><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2015 22:43:34 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Shop Direct Extends Partnership with IBM Cloud to Accelerate Digital Transformation</title><link>http://us.rd.yahoo.com/finance/external/noodlsaunz/rss/SIG=125h93gpo/*http://www.noodls.com/view/2F46E96558B8AF4DC35FCE0D8B2ABD094926A43E</link><description>[at noodls] - LONDON and ARMONK, N.Y. - 09 Feb 2015: today announced it has signed a 10-year, large-scale services agreement with Shop Direct to move the multi-brand digital retailer to a hybrid cloud model to increase ...</description><guid isPermaLink="false">yahoo_finance/2114877617</guid><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2015 14:06:22 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>IBM Teams With More Than 300 Colleges and Universities to Educate New Generation of Innovators</title><link>http://us.rd.yahoo.com/finance/external/noodlsaunz/rss/SIG=125tepoc5/*http://www.noodls.com/view/4FA8545D46CC6ECB27960875B32D540FDD944341</link><description>[at noodls] - ARMONK, NY - 09 Feb 2015: IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced that its Power Systems Academic Initiative (PSAI) has achieved a major milestone by enrolling more than 300 colleges and universities around the ...</description><guid isPermaLink="false">yahoo_finance/1776929517</guid><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2015 14:06:22 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>IBM Expands Global Research Network into South Africa</title><link>http://us.rd.yahoo.com/finance/external/noodlsaunz/rss/SIG=1259drhbp/*http://www.noodls.com/view/997FADCE393FB7B8F1AD1364F62B8C46788135A1</link><description>[at noodls] - Johannesburg - 06 Feb 2015: IBM (NYSE: IBM ) today announced plans to expand IBM Research - Africa with a new laboratory in Johannesburg beginning April 2015.

The technology company, which has posted lower revenue for 11 quarters in a row as it struggles to transform itself into a cloud-based software and services company, withheld annual bonuses in 2013 at the executives&apos; own request. The bonuses returned as a feature of IBM&apos;s executive compensation for 2014, according to a document filed with securities regulators on Friday, despite the fact that IBM&apos;s net profit from continuing operations fell 7 percent last year and its stock shed about 14 percent.

U.S. Treasury yields declined and the euro rose against the dollar after news reports that the ECB, which will hold a policy meeting on Thursday, plans to buy roughly 50 billion euros ($58 billion) in bonds per month for at least one year. The FTSEurofirst 300 index that tracks European stock markets turned positive on the news reports and was last ahead 0.4 percent. U.S. stocks opened down, in part because International Business Machines Corp issued a disappointing outlook, but rose after the reports on the ECB bond-buying program.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">yahoo_finance/551398818</guid><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2015 16:53:08 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>US STOCKS-Wall St rises on report of ECB action</title><link>http://us.rd.yahoo.com/finance/news/rss/story/*http://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/us-stocks-wall-st-rises-160931959.html</link><description></description><guid isPermaLink="false">yahoo_finance/1926365724</guid><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2015 16:09:31 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>US STOCKS-Wall St edges up on ECB hopes, but IBM weighs</title><link>http://us.rd.yahoo.com/finance/news/rss/story/*http://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/us-stocks-wall-st-edges-150935130.html</link><description></description><guid isPermaLink="false">yahoo_finance/117288150</guid><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2015 15:09:35 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
